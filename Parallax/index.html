        <h2>Manchester City have been crowned UEFA Champions League winners</h2>
<p>Rodrigo's goal secured the victory on a glorious night for the football club that saw scenes of jubilation among the City supporters inside the Ataturk Stadium and across the world.

    The victory over Inter completes a historic Treble, with our European crown added to our Premier League and FA Cup successes.
    "The Champions League is a beautiful competition, and we are all incredibly happy to have won. This team deserves the highest recognition and winning the Champions League elevates us to the very top of the game.

    “And to win the Treble is something amazing. It is the ultimate achievement for any club team, and we have done it. It reflects the quality we have in our squad, but it also shows how dedicated we are.
    
    “I want to thank the Manchester City fans for their support this season. I can honestly say that we could not have done this without them. They have been amazing, and they deserve this moment.”
    City will now begin the 2023/24 season with an opportunity to play in the European Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, as well having the chance to become the first team in the history of English football to win four league titles in succession.

    Everyone at Manchester City would like to send their congratulations to Pep, his backroom staff and all the players on a wonderful achievement.</p>    </section>

        <h2>Manchester City have been crowned champions of the 2022/23 Premier League season.</h2>
<p>The Citizens headed into the weekend knowing that a victory over Chelsea on Sunday would be enough to secure the title, but as it turned down, they didn't even need to play to seal their triumph as Arsenal's slip-up against Nottingham Forest on Saturday meant the Gunners could no longer climb back into top spot.
    Pep Guardiola has now won five Premier League titles since moving to England, while this is the seventh time that City have got their hands on the trophy.
    Manchester City's 2022/23 domestic triumph records a remarkable three on the trot, which is a feat only managed by Manchester United - who have done it twice - in the Premier League era. In the 135-year history of English league football, Huddersfield (1920s), Arsenal (1930s) and Liverpool (1980s) are the only other clubs to have managed three in a row. No one has ever done four.
    Three on the bounce was previously snatched from within City's grasp when Liverpool interrupted the party and picked up the 2019/20 Premier League, after Pep Guardiola's side had won it in both the 2017/18 and 2018/19 campaigns. But the opportunity to surpass Manchester United and the rest by registering a fourth consecutive title next season will be one that Pep will relish.
